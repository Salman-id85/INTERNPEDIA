# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

# 1. Initialize Project
Ensure the Directory Structure is Set Up Correctly: Organize your project into folders such as data/ for datasets, src/ for source code, notebooks/ for Jupyter notebooks, and tests/ for unit tests. This helps in maintaining a clean and manageable project.
Git Initialization: Use Git to initialize a version-controlled repository. This allows you to track changes, collaborate with others, and manage different versions of your project.

# 2. Data Preparation
Load the Dataset: Read the CSV (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset) file into a pandas DataFrame using pd.read_csv(). This step is crucial for loading and working with your data.
Rename Columns: Update column names for easier access and clarity. This makes it simpler to reference columns in your code, especially if the original names are not descriptive.
Drop Unnecessary Columns: Remove columns that are not relevant to the analysis or model training. This helps in focusing on the necessary data and avoids potential confusion or errors.
Drop Missing Values: Clean the dataset by removing rows with missing values to ensure that the data used for training is complete and reliable. Incomplete data can lead to inaccurate model predictions.
Map Labels: Convert categorical labels (e.g., 'ham' and 'spam') into binary values (0 and 1). This transformation is necessary because machine learning algorithms require numerical input.
Split Data: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split(). The training set is used to train the model, while the test set is used to evaluate its performance. This ensures that the model is tested on unseen data.

# 3. Feature Extraction
TF-IDF Vectorization: Convert the email text into numerical features using TfidfVectorizer(). TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is a method that transforms text data into a matrix of numerical values, reflecting the importance of words in the context of the entire dataset. This process makes text data suitable for machine learning algorithms.

# 4. Model Training
Naive Bayes Model: Train a Multinomial Naive Bayes model using MultinomialNB(). This model is well-suited for text classification tasks, as it assumes that the presence of a word in a document is independent of the presence of any other word. It is effective for handling the high-dimensionality of text data.

# 5. Model Evaluation
Predict: Use the trained model to make predictions on the test set with model.predict(). This step allows you to assess how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.
Evaluate: Calculate the model's accuracy and generate a classification report using accuracy_score() and classification_report(). These metrics provide insights into the model's performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# 6. Model Persistence
Save Models: Store the trained model and vectorizer to disk using joblib.dump(). This step allows you to save the model for future use without needing to retrain it. It also saves the vectorizer, which is essential for transforming new data in the same way as the training data.
This detailed explanation covers the essential steps of setting up, preparing, and executing an email spam detection project using Python. Each section is designed to ensure that the project is well-organized, the data is properly handled, the model is effectively trained and evaluated, and the results are preserved for future use.
